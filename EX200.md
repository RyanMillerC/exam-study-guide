* `ssh-copy-id` will copy the public key to a server

* `/var/log/boot.log` - Non-syslog

### Syslog

* Syslog priority levels go from 0-7 with 0 being emergency and 7 being debug
* Syslog is primarily configured in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`
* Syslog can also be configured modularly in `/etc/rsyslog.d/<name>.conf`
* `logger -p <service>.<topic> "<message>"` can be used to manually send a
  message to syslog

### Journald
