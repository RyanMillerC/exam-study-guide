# RHCSA

## Users and Passwords

* Default values for users and passwords can be set in /etc/login.defs
* `w` command will show logged in users and what they are running
* `pkill -u <user>` can kill all processes for a given user

## File Permissions

* `u+s` - SUID
    * File executes as owner instead of running user
* `g+s` - SGID
    * File executes as the group owner instead of running user
    * Files directed in a directory with GUID bit set will be group owned by
      the directory group owner
* `o+t` - Sticky Bit
    * Files in a directory with sticky bit can only be removed by their owner

## Systemd

* `systemctl list-units --type=service --all` will list systemd services
* `systemctl mask <service>` will prevent the service from starting, even if a
  user tries to run it

## SSH

* `ssh-keygen` will create a public/private key pair
* `ssh-copy-id` will copy the public key to a server
* System sshd config is located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    * **Any changes to SSH config require an sshd restart!**
* `PermitRootLogin yes` in sshd config will allow root to use SSH

## Logging

* `logrotate` is used to rotate logs

### Log File Locations

* `/var/log/messages` - General logs (syslog) not configured with systemd
* `/var/log/secure` - Security and authentication logs
* `/var/log/maillog` - Mail server logs
* `/var/log/cron` - Cron job logs
* `/var/log/boot.log` - Non-syslog

### Syslog

* Syslog priority levels go from 0-7 with 0 being emergency and 7 being debug
* Syslog is primarily configured in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`
* Syslog can also be configured modularly in `/etc/rsyslog.d/<name>.conf`
* `logger -p <service>.<topic> "<message>"` can be used to manually send a
  message to syslog

### Journald

* `journalctl -p <level>` will show logs at the given priority level and lower
* `journalctl --since "-1 hour"` will show logs from the last hour
* `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` is the configuration file for journalctl
* `Storage: persistent` in journald.conf will persist logs between boots
    * You must restart systemd-journald for change to take effect
* `journalctl -b <number>` to see a specific boot

## Time

* `timdatectl set-timezone <time-zone>` is used to set the timezone
* `chronyc` is used to manage hardware clock
* `/etc/chrony.conf` controls cronyd service

## Networking

* `nmcli` is used to manage network interfaces
* `nmcli con add con-name <interface> type ethernet ifname <interface>`
* `nmcli con up <interface>`
* You can also manually edit configs under /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts and
  then run `nmcli con reload`

## Package Management

* `subscription-manager register`
* `yum module`

## SELinux

* `setroubleshoot-server` will log SELinux issues to /var/logs/messages
* `semanage fcontext -l` will list all context assignments

## Storage

* `parted` is cooler than `fdisk`
* `udevadm settle` will make a system scan for new disk partitions
* `systemctl daemon-reload` after editing /etc/fstab for changes to sync
* `lsblk` to get disk info
